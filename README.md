# clemsonyear3
Personal GitHub repository for archiving code written for classes at Clemson University
  > `During the 2017-2018 Academic Year`

All code in this repository is free for anyone's use. I doubt it will be too terribly useful to very many people.
Any comments, constructive criticism, or concerns can be emailed to me or commented on the repo as well.

Contents should include code written for Clemson's classes on:
  > `Software Development Foundations (Java Language and Concepts)`
  
  > `Software Dev Foundations Lab (Lab corresponding to the above lecture)`
  
  > `Microcontroller Interfacing (And its corresponding Lab)`
  
  > `Signals and Systems (Likely will be mostly MATLAB code)`
  
  All constructive comments are appreciated.
