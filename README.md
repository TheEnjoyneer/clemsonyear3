Personal GitHub repository for archiving code written for classes at Clemson University
  > `During the 2017-2018 Academic Year`

All code in this repository is free for anyone's use. I doubt it will be too terribly useful to very many people.
Any comments, constructive criticism, or concerns can be emailed to me or commented on the repo as well.

Fall 2017 Semester contents should include code written and documents for Clemson's classes on:
  > `CPSC 2150 Software Development Foundations (Java Language and Concepts)`
  
  > `CPSC 2151 Software Dev Foundations Lab (Lab corresponding to the above lecture)`
  
  > `ECE 3720 Microcontroller Interfacing (And its corresponding Lab)`
  
  > `ECE 3300 Signals and Systems (Likely will be mostly MATLAB code)`
  
Spring 2018 Semester contents should include code written and documents for Clemson's classes on:
  > `ECE 3170 Random Signal Analysis (Random Signal Occurrences and Analysis Tools)`
  
  > `ECE 3220 Introduction to Operating Systems (Operating Systems Basics/Kernel Basics)`
  
  > `ECE 3520 Programming Systems (Advanced Programming Languges and Systems)`
  
  > `ECE 6380 Computer Communications (TCP/IP/Sockets and Basic Routing/Internet Protocols)`
  
  All constructive comments are appreciated.
