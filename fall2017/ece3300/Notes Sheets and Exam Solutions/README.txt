These are my personal notes sheets that I made for the class. They aren't perfect, but they worked for me. Several of them have extra pages with examples on them that I later discovered were unneccessary. 
All the notes sheets only need the first 2 pages printed, BUT MAKE SURE YOU REVIEW THEM BEFORE PRINTING.

When printing, make sure you print in color and set the printer to high quality  & duplex (front and back printing).

For the test solutions, please note that some of the answers may be confusing or hard to understand. This is 100% because I couldn't read what the TA was writing on the board during the exam review sessions.

Good luck!
