 * The TicTacToe controller class will handle communication between our TicTacToeView and our Model (IGameBoard and BoardPosition)
 *
 * This is where you will write code
 *
 * You will need to include your BoardPosition class, the IGameBoard interface
 * and one of the IGameBoard implementations from Homework 4
 * You can choose which IGameBoard implementation to use
 * If your code was correct you will not need to make any changes to your IGameBoard implementation class besides the package name
